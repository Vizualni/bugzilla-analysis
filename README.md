## Bugzilla-analysis

This is project I made for class called *seminar*.

Main point of this is to analize data on bugzilla pages and create ranking
list of best software.

ToDo List:
* Add support for questom queries
* Transfer all data to MySQL database
* Automatic downloading and farming bugs for later analysis
